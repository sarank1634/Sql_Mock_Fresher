## 1.What is SQL?

```SQL means Structured Query Language and is used to communicate with relational databases. It proposes a standardized way to interact with databases, allowing users to perform various operations on the data, including retrieval, insertion, updating, and deletion.```

## 2. What are the different types of SQL commands?

```SQL commands are grouped into categories:

DDL (Data Definition Language): CREATE, ALTER, DROP, TRUNCATE

DML (Data Manipulation Language): INSERT, UPDATE, DELETE

DQL (Data Query Language): SELECT

DCL (Data Control Language): GRANT, REVOKE

TCL (Transaction Control Language): COMMIT, ROLLBACK, SAVEPOINT ```


## 3. What is the difference between Database, DBMS, and RDBMS?

```Database: Organized collection of data.

DBMS: Software to manage databases (e.g., MS Access).

RDBMS: A DBMS using relational tables with rows and columns, supporting relationships 
      (e.g., MySQL, PostgreSQL, SQL Server).```

## 4. What is a Primary Key?

```A column or set of columns that uniquely identify each row. A primary key cannot contain duplicates or NULLs.```

## 5. What is a foreign key?

```Foreign key is a field in one table referencing the primary key in another. It establishes a relationship between the two tables, ensuring data consistency and enabling data retrieval across tables.```

## 6. What is a Unique Key?

```Often referred to as a unique constraint, a unique key guarantees that every value in a column (or a combination of columns) remains distinct and cannot be replicated within a table. In contrast to a primary key, a table has the flexibility to incorporate multiple unique keys.```

## 7. What is the difference between SQL and NoSQL?

```SQL: Relational, structured, ACID-compliant.

NoSQL: Non-relational, schema-free, designed for scalability.```

## 8. What are the advantages of SQL?

```Standardized language
Portable across databases
Supports complex queries and joins
Ensures data integrity```

## 9. What is NULL in SQL?

```NULL represents missing or unknown data. It is not zero or an empty string. To check NULLs, use IS NULL or IS NOT NULL.```

## 10. What is the difference between CHAR and VARCHAR?

```CHAR(n): Fixed length; pads unused space with blanks.

VARCHAR(n): Variable length; stores only entered characters.```
